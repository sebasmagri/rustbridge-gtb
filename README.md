## Adding a new workshop

Create a new `.md` post in `content/` and make sure you set the `category` entry to `"workshops"` in the _frontmatter_. The filename should follow this convention:

    YYYY-MM-DD-city-slug.md

Where `YYYY-MM-DD` refers to the date of the workshop.

## Adding members to the team

Create a new `.md` post in `content/` and make sure you set the `category` entry to `"members"` in the _frontmatter_
